# Getting Started
To run this project on your local machine, you need to follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ipl-price-prediction.git.

Install the necessary dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

Run the app.py file to execute the program.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is taken from Kaggle, which contains the IPL player and team stats for the years 2008-2019. You can find the dataset in the data folder of this repository.

# Data Preprocessing
Before feeding the data into the machine learning model, we first preprocess it to remove any null values, convert categorical variables into numerical values, and perform feature scaling to normalize the data.

# Model Training
We use two machine learning algorithms, logistic regression and random forest classifier, to train our model on the preprocessed data. We split the dataset into training and testing sets, and evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

# Results
Our model achieves an accuracy of 85% on the testing set, which indicates that it can predict the IPL player price with reasonable accuracy based on their previous performance stats and team stats.

# Future Improvements
There are several ways in which this project can be improved in the future, such as using more advanced machine learning algorithms, incorporating more features into the model, and using more recent data to improve the accuracy of the predictions.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms to predict the IPL player price based on their previous performance stats and team stats. It can be used by cricket teams and franchises to make informed decisions about player selection and auction bids.

# This project is not mine, I fine tuned it's model for better accuracy. If you have any doubts or query shoot me dm on ig @hello.lakshya
